  <h2>A Place I Would Like To Vist</h2>

  <p>I would love to visit the U.K.. I would like to go there because by what I see on the
   internet and what people tell me about over there, it sounds like an amazing place.</p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"><li>this is a wikipedia of the U.K.</li></a>

  <h2>A Person I Admire
  
  <br>
  
  (Past or Present)</h2>
  
  <p> I admire my father. I admire him because ,him, in my eyes when I was little he had 
  the most confidence in the world so he always gave me confidence.He is the reason I get
  up in the morning and do all the things I do. In sports I sweat my butt off for him and 
  in school I try my best for him no matter what.</p>
